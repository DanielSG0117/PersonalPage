            <h2>Comprarme un Pa Gammer</h2>
            <p>Building a gaming PC from scratch is the only sure-fire way to ensure that your system is capable of
                satisfying all of your personal preferences. When you determine everything that goes into your PC from
                the power supply up, you know that you'll be able to play the games you want at the frame rates you
                want. In addition, a home-built PC keeps the door open for upgrades — as technology changes, as your
                gaming tastes and needs change, or as your budget allows.</p>
            <p>Though building a PC can seem intimidating, you might find that it’s easier than you think, especially
                when broken into manageable steps. That's why we've put together this comprehensive step-by-step guide
                to building your first gaming PC, complete with tips and tricks from our veteran builders.</p>

            <h3>PREP 1: PC Build Tools</h3>
            <p>The first thing you need to do to prepare is gather the tools you need to complete the build. Preparing
                the materials below ahead of time goes a long way to ensure that the build process goes smoothly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Workspace: You will need a large surface to work on, such as a table. To prevent an
                    accidental
                    electrostatic discharge (which can damage sensitive components), make sure you stand on an
                    uncarpeted surface.</li>
                <li>ScrewdriversYou will need a Phillips #2 screwdriver for just about everything. If
                    you're installing an M.2 device, you'll also need a Phillips #0 screwdriver.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eligendi rerum, porro facilis perspiciatis illo
                nulla earum aspernatur incidunt similique veniam.</p>

            <h3>PREP 2: Gaming PC Cases</h3>
            <p>Before you start picking out components, you should have a case — or, at least, a case size — in mind.
            </p>
            <p>The main thing to keep in mind when picking a case is where you're going to put the computer. Your PC's
                final location will dictate how big you can (or cannot) go, and it will also help determine whether
                various premium case features are worth splurging on. You probably don't want to pay for a tempered
                glass side panel if the computer will be hidden under your desk, for example.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>PREP 3: Gaming PC Parts</h3>
            <p>Now it's time to get your components together. This step can be as hands-on or as hands-off as you like;
                you can thoroughly research each individual component on your own and create a custom build from
                scratch, or you can find a pre-made build online and adjust it to suit your specific budget and needs.
            </p>
            <p>We definitely recommend coming up with a budget before you start picking components (it's easy for
                component shopping to get out of hand). Remember, you can always upgrade individual components later.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to your case, here are the components you need to build a gaming PC:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Central processing unit (CPU)</li>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                <li>Memory (RAM)</li>
                <li>Graphics processing unit (GPU)</li>
                <li>Storage</li>
                <li>Power supply unit (PSU)</li>
                <li>System cooling</li>
                <li>Gaming peripherals</li>
                <li>Operating system(OS)</li>
            </ul>
